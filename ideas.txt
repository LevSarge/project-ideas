Capstone Ideas (Python-AH3)

Idea 1: Dungeons and Dragons Quick Character Creator
Have you ever just needed to create yourself a new character for that one shot your friend talked about, but you wanted to speed up the process? 
Maybe even not have to use dice to do it? 
You tried D&D Beyond but hate how they locked features behind subscription services. 
OrcPub was nice but it had legal action taken against it, so what to do?
-I had this idea swimming around in my brain when I was studying web development but I felt like JavaScript was making the whole process too complicated.

Idea 2: Build Your Music Collection
I love collecting music, whether it's CDs, Vinyl, Cassette, or even MP3 files. 
-catalog your collection, 
-edit metadata, 
-how many times you listened through individual songs or whole albums?

Idea 3: Randomized Monster Fighter
-I remember playing "Kingdom of Loathing", a browser based RPG game where you were a stick-man fighting monsters, gaining loot and getting upgrades.
-A Flask application where you could:
  - have a randomly generated character with different stats (which you could save to a file)
  - go through randomly generated battles with monsters 
  - options to rest or continue to another battle
  
 Idea 4: Build a Diet Plan
 -Thinking of changing your diet to have more vegetables, fruits, seafood, etc.?
 -Track exercise time and routines
 -Meditation section for mental and emotional health
 
 Idea 5: Writing/Drawing prompt randomizer
-Randomizer for themes to write
-Randomizer for drawing prompts
-Randomizer that could mix and match text from dictionaries from both
-Options for user submitted prompts to be mixed in with prompts if stored
